This third Sabbatical started on Friday, June 5th, 2020 with the last day teaching at the AISVN (American International School Vietnam). It lasted for a year until I started working as a teacher again at the SSIS (Saigon South International School) in June 2021.

## Projects during the sabbatical

One unfinished project marked the beginning of the Sabbatical: the solar project at AISVN. On this Friday, I was still soldering the data collection board with the ESP32:

And on the next Monday I returned to school to [[Start of my third Sabbatical]], which in turn was a continuation of this project

## Working as a tutor
A few days into my sabbatical I was asked if I would like to teach chemistry according to the Canadian curriculum a few hours each day of the week. Well, there is a lot to learn, so why not?
