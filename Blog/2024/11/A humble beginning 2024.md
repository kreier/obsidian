It’s been a while in my path of organized note taking apps. I installed [Notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(productivity_software) in **November 2023**, then again in **October 2024** when we visited Peter in Da Nang. It looks nice and has many features as a commercial product.
### Open source
Since 2018 I use GitHub. And like many others I like Open Source, open standards and free access to information. I learned HTML in 1999, LaTeX in 2000 and MarkDown in 2018 with my students, finally combinding it with Python into a Jupyter Notebook in 2019. So Obsidian it is.

So I installed [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)) on my iPhone on **November 21rd, 2024**, during my visa run to Cambodia. And I made my first entry with my iPad. This here is it! Third became a daily note [[2024-11-21]]. But the question of syncing took another year to finally find a fitting repository. [[2024-11-21]]

Then finally, on October 21st, 2025, this whole project was reactivated.
