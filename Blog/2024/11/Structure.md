I might have to use a folder. This is actually my third note in Obsidian from November 21st, 2024.

And I can make lists:
- First Point
- Second point

But is it like a Jupyter Notebook and can execute python as well?

Let’s link the other two pages I created first. So there is  [[A humble beginning 2024]] which is my first document. And then there is [[Note the second]] that is already moved to a subfolder.

The left menu lets you automatically create a document that has the current date as title. So I accidentally created [[2024-11-21 First use of Obsidian]] today. Well, that’s how it goes.
