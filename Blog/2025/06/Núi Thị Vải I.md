First attempt. A little too late, it's heavy raining and while I make it to the peak it's not a loop.

Got to the top, but to pyramid shaped marker? Incomplete recording, started about 16:00, lost the way, but was back at the bike 18:12 before dark. 1155 kcal, no loop. Elevation gain: 456 m?

A month later at [[Núi Thị Vải II]] I will close the loop in 1h32. Arriving earlier at 14:50 instead of 16:00 and knowing where to go. Strava heat maps are a real help! Real elevation gain was probably only 411 meters.
