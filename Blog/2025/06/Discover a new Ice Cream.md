And another surpize. The sisters had invited our two German visitors for a boat tour on the Saigon river, and to another dinner afterwards. At 22:00 it was time again to go home, but J. asked me "Wollen wir noch einen trinken gehen?". Not that she (or any of us) would drink alcohol, but we used the next 5 hours to continue our conversation from the day before.  
  
One new thing I learned was the Korean Mango ice cream that seems to be rather popular. But I have never tried it before!
