Back from Cambodia (again, see [[2024-12-19]]) I finally created a GitHub repository for Obsidian. Copied the vault into the correct subfolder, and see where this leads.

The Obsidian App saves your words and changes to your local file system. Which git monitors, just open the GitHub Desktop app. It automatically shows you all the files you changed, and what you changed. A simple push has it backed up. And since it is on iCloud, it is also automatically synced.

Now to the web view with the backlinks and network. That's one more thing for my ToDo list.
