Here in Cambodia, writing about the [[GPGPU]]s of [[Nvidia]]. Its interesting. Using my visa run to start using Obsidian, that I installed in November. But without a GitHub backup and web publishing (like with quartz) it didn't go far.

This was solved a year later, again with a visit to Cambodia. It's [[Reactivated 2025]]. At the same time I tried to reactivate Wordpress, since it supports tags, keyword bubbles and sorting by publishing date.
