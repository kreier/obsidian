End of October was the wedding of Thai and Tram in Hanoi. Right thereafter a group wanted to do a tour of the Hà Giang loop. So I planned to go to Hanoi by bike and have my own motorbike available in the mountains. Events leading up to this journey made it all a little more time constrained.
## 09-25 Leave Vietnam for a Visa?
In early September it was finally decided that my course as "Culture of Vietnam and the Vietnamese Language" was accepted at the University of Education HCM. A welcoming ceremony was held on September 21st. In order to get my 1 year visa I have to leave Vietnam and receive it abroad. I would leave on September 25th, but the procedure needs 6 working days, and I would have to stay outside the country to wait for the invitation letter. Since a trip to Can Tho (Half marathon on September 14th) was planned for October 3rd to 6th, I postponed the trip to Cambodia.
## 10-07 Cambodia until October 20th
I left Vietnam as indicated on October 7th, but my application was only submitted on October 8th. While it was processed in Vietnam, I had to wait in Phnom Penh to finally get the invitation letter. On Thursday, October 16th it finally arrived. I went to the embassy, and it is only 145 USD if you wait 5 working days. Waiting 3 working days and you pay 160 USD. Or get it the same day for 205 USD. So I waited 3 working days (Thursday, Friday and Monday) to get the visa finally on Monday, October 20th. Time to return to Vietnam, start registration etc.
## 10-24 Saigon - Măng Đen 624.1 km
I started on this [[2025#Start of the Second Road Trip to Hanoi|Friday]] early in the morning to avoid the rush hour in Ho Chi Minh City. Before lunch I was already in Gia Nghia, and shortly thereafter in Buon Ma Thuot. With sunshine I continued to Pleiku, Kon Tum and had the first raindrops after sunset closer to Mang Den.
## 10-25 Huế 420.2 km
It started raining in Măng Đen and only got more intense, the further north I drove. I had the mountain road in better memory. Yet the first 140 kilometers to Bắc Trà My (near Đập Thủy Điện Sông Tranh 2) were alternating between older concrete roads and asphalt roads with potholes. On two occasions the road was swept away with a landslide from the rainfalls of previous days. And since it kept raining the whole day, it included a mud river crossing the street, that had me loose my flipflops while trying to cross the street there.

The next 108 km from Bắc Trà My to tt. Thạnh Mỹ, crossing the Hiệp Hòa Tunnel, were slightly better. For brief moments, the rain stopped, and one could enjoy the mountain panorama and meandering streets. Arriving in Thạnh Mỹ, the rain had stopped and I was ready for lunch. For the next leg I chose the coastal road.

And getting closer to Danang it started raining again, and did not stop even until 150 milometers late until 5:30 PM in Huế. So I got a bed in a Nhà Nghỉ and prepared for the Saturday evening zoom meeting.
## 10-26 Hà Nội 650.4 km
It kept raining in the morning until around lunch time or 373 km later, when I arrived in Vinh. Then it stopped, and I could dry in the wind while finishing the 3-day trip to Hanoi.
## 10-27 First day of study - Hà Nội 30.1 km
It Monday, the first day of my study at the University of Education Ho Chi Minh City (**Trường Đại học Sư phạm TP. Hồ Chí Minh**) as a bachelor of Vietnamese Language and Culture of Vietnam (**Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hóa Việt Nam**). We have our meeting over Google Meet for 2 hours and the first 5 students meet there, most for the first time. Two other students are still in China and are waiting for their visa.
## 10-28 Trip to **Lào Cai**, China and Sapa 369.9 km
I arrived in **Lào Cai** at about 4:00 PM. On Google it states that the border crossing is closing at 5:00 PM, but this only applies for cars. You can walk there until 10:00 PM. Many Vietnamese get a 3 day tourist visa, valid for an area of 7 kilometers from the border gate. I get a 30 day visa exception for China and walk over to He Kou, visit [the train station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XGDCVtwRArgQBSex6) and downtown. Two hours later, I will return to Vietnam. 
## 10-29 Fansipan 21.1 km
It is a sunny day, as predicted on Monday.
## 10-30 Return to Hà Nội 385.4 km
Nhung's family invited me to stay at their place. Immediately I was involved with the family, no time to "just leave" for the English meeting, or visit the central congregation
## 10-31 Wedding of Thai and Tram 0 km
Nhung's sister is taking us to the KH with her car, so we're not bothered by the rain. Dỉnh has an encouraging talk for the new couple. After that we enjoy the company of all the guests with some good food.
## 11-01 Wedding part II in Hung Yen 50 km
It's slightly raining again. The second wedding part at Thai's parents house is supposed to start at 11:00 AM. Trâm sent a message that we should start earlier in the North, at 10:00 AM. But we can already arrive at 9:00 AM, which we do. And the party is already in full swing!
## 11-02 The long journey to Lũng Cú 496.8 km
In the morning I can finally meet with Markus at a Cafe. We're both in Vietnam since 2016, but never actually met. With the exeption of a coincidence in Quy Nhon in August 2025. Hanoi and Saigon are far away and we have limited time to visit each others cities.

Minh's family is still in Hanoi, but leaving for Nha Trang from the airport at 2:00 PM. With a better helmet I pick her up at her sisters house, and we start the journey to Hà Giang. With leaving 2:00 pm from the airport we might be in Lũng Cú at 11:00 pm, if there are no stops, good streets etc. Well, it will take significantly longer, but we'll make it safe. 

One hour in hour journey and out of Hà Nội the rain finally stops. It get's dark at 5:30, and we continue until 9:00 PM. Some 150 kilometers are still to go to and continue to 

Should we stop for a little Pho or Com? No, we continue into the mountains. Refill the gasoline one last time, since the stations will close at 10:00 PM and we still have a long way to go.

Since it is dark, foggy, unknown meandering mountain roads up to 1400 meters and no one else on the road it takes a little longer, but we arrive save at 3:00 AM in Lũng Cú. Nhung is awake and makes us a Ginger tea to welcome us. I get a new name: Thiên Sứ, since we did not eat or drink anything for 12 hours!
## 11-03 Monday, Phố Cổ, Đồng Văn 39.1 km
Trip to the flag pole. 54 square meteres (6x9 meters) represents the 54 local minorities and etnicities in Vietnam.

The afternoon we travel to the historic market in Đồng Văn. It has some great photo spots again.
## 11-04 Cốc Pảng and Du Gia Panorama Ecolodge 114.9 km
On the way to Cốc Pảng Minh and I hike to a little overhanging rock next to the road for nice pictures, that other tourists took as well.
The afternoon is for pictures in the gorge of Cốc Pảng. Ngoc and Cuong get some impressive wedding pictures taken.

The story of their photographer is not less impressive. One includes a bicycle journey to China for a week and the return with a black inflatable boat over the river. Of course picked up at the factory in China itself, giving a tour of the facilities. Connected prior to this journey with Aliexpress.
## 11-05 Leaving the mountains, Hà Giang to Vinh 614.8 km
Sunrice pictures of the valley in front of the Du Gia Panorama Ecolodge, and having good and bad roads to breakfast Banh Cuon, where I have to leave for the road. The others will catch a plane later the day.
## 11-06 Approaching Typhoon Kalmaegi, stopping in Quảng Ngãi 636.1 km
The warning of the Tyhoon pops up in Google Maps, and from Hue on it starts to rain, never to stop. Some streets in Danang are already flooded. At about 8:00 PM the gas stations are closed near Quảng Ngãi. All shops are closed, the streets are empty and deserted. Many hotels are closed as well, storefronts are packed for storm and rain. I have to stop a little earlier, but its probably better and safer.

## 11-07 Journey through storm damage territory, back to Saigon 822.4 km
At 6:00 AM the streets are busy again, the sun is slowly rising and with no rain will dry my soaked clothes in just 30 minutes on the road.

Yet some streets have fallen trees from left to right. For hours it is a journey through storm damage territory. Roofs are missing, advertisement boards are toppled over, power lines and telephone lines. Some streets have all planted trees lying on the street. Near Quy Nhon it is damage whereever one looks. They are out of water for a day, and electricity in parts of the city will need another 3 days.

At almost midnight I arrive back in district 7. It's been 5275.5 kilometers!
## 11-08 Circuit assembly on Saturday
I made it back in time, so I can attend the English circuit assembly on the weekend. Yay!
