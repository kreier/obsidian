This mountain 3 hours north of Saigon stands out of the flat surrounding and can be seen from far away. With almost 1000 meter height rising from the lowlands it has become a tourist spot. Now having 5 cable cars on its flanks its easier and faster than ever to get to the top.
## Hiking
Of course we are interested in hiking up the mountain. Here is my personal history.
