While being a popular sport in western countries this outdoor activity is slowly taking off in Vietnam, too. Some popular destinations I tested myself:
## Núi Đinh
Been there two times, the second time finishing the red 6 hour loop.
## [[Black Virgin Mountain - Núi Bà Đen]]
Now I've been there already 4 times! Here are a few things to consider:

If you are not trained it will take at least 4 hours to get up to the top. We tested on February 16th, 2026. We stopped halfway. Another thing is to consider the time and distance. From 2026 on you have to start your ascend before 11 am. A park warden let's you enter your name and phone number and size of group before you can climb up.
## Angel mountains in Nha Trang
Went there in August 2025 on an afternoon. The descent was in the dark!
