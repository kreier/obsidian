While being a popular sport in western countries this outdoor activity is slowly taking off in Vietnam, too. Some popular destinations I tested myself:
## Núi Đinh
Been there two times, the second time finishing the red 6 hour loop. Did it in 4:57 on 2025-07-07 and burned 2048 kcal total. 14.97 km distance, elevation gain 706 meter. Maximum height: 518 m

- [[Núi Đinh I]] - 2023-11-26 - more than 6 hours with shortcut
- [[Núi Đinh II]] - 2025-07-07 - finished loop after 4h57

## Núi Thị Vải 
Two times, second time I found the "peak" which is 50 meter below the peak and 200 meters away. Height: 467 meter, trip of about 1h40. 5.07 km distance. 913 kcal total. 

- [[Núi Thị Vải I]] - - 2025-06-20 - top but no cairn
- [[Núi Thị Vải II]] - 2025-07-24 - top, loop 1h40, picture of cairn 50 m below peak
## [[Black Virgin Mountain - Núi Bà Đen]]
Now I've been there already 4 times! Here are a few things to consider:

If you are not trained it will take at least 4 hours to get up to the top. We tested on February 16th, 2026. We stopped halfway. Another thing is to consider the time and distance. From 2026 on you have to start your ascend before 11 am. A park warden let's you enter your name and phone number and size of group before you can climb up.

- Black Virgin Mountain I - 2021/12/24 - Covid
- [[Black Virgin Mountain II]]  - 2025/12/12 - 350 meters
- [[Black Virgin Mountain III]] - 2026/01/04 - top
- [[Black Virgin Mountain IV]] - 2026/02/16 - 500 meters
