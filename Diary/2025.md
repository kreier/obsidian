### Regional Convention “Pure Worship”
**15.08.2025** Friday - It is Jehovah your God you must worship. But what is pure worship? 6 points to identify:
1. Matthew 4:10 pure must be directed to Jehovah
2. John 16:27 One must also love and learn about Jesus
3. John 17:17 Must be based on God's word, the truth
4. Matthew 24:14 You must be involved in the preaching work worldwide
5. John 13:34, 35 Others will be able to identify because of the self sacrificing love
6. John 15:17 No part of the world

3 ways that Jesus was a champion of pure worship:
1. Matthew 4:10 real temptations, use your powers selfishly, Jehovah hasn’t provided for you with food, make spectacle, and you can get your kingdom earlier! Jesus answer: “It is Jehovah alone you must render sacred service”
2. John 2:16, 17 “Take these things away from here”, the zeal for your house will consume me, he was zealous for pure worship
3. John 4:23, 24 immortality of the soul? Not found in the scriptures, but Greek scholars promoted it. Therefore: in spirit and TRUTH to worship, and Jesus championed for it, he upheld the truth

**16.08.2025** Saturday - The zeal for your house will consume me. Learn more about John the Baptist, Andrew, Peter, John, James, Philip and Nathanael<br />
**17.08.2025** Sunday - Worship the Father with spirit and truth. Lessons From What Jesus Said: “Born From Water and Spirit” (John 3:3, 5), “No Man Has Ascended Into Heaven” (John 3:13), “Come to the Light” (John 3:19-21), “I Am He” (John 4:25, 26), “My Food” (John 4:34), “The Fields . . . Are White for Harvesting” (John 4:35).

The public bible discourse was themed: **Do You Worship What You Know?** But not a new problem. See Jesus in John 4:22 You worship what you *do not know*; Romans 10:2 They have a zeal for god, but *not according to accurate knowledge*, Romans 12:1 serving God that is acceptable, with *your power of reason* (logicos), logical. **Things that don’t satisfy our mind have no right to satisfy your heart.** We are encouraged to really search for the truth:
1) Accept that truth does exist (example story from a village with 6 blind man, try to perceive what an elephant is: Like a wall, tree, spear, snake, fan, rope - different opinions)
2) Take your search for truth seriously
3) Give the Bible and unbiased examination
4) Reject falsehood

**01.09.2025** Monday, the start of a new service year! In service with Hiếu in Nha Trang. Walking on the railroad tracks like in India, talking to a woman on the bridge. Are her prayers answered when burning money? Don’t know yet, it’s the first time! Evening at the [Armenian restaurant in Nha Trang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y2QXzwWatpHVr2yS7) with friends.<br />
**02.09.2025** Tuesday is Independence day of Vietnam and this year is a big celebration in Vietnam since it’s now 50 years. Fireworks in Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh, but it’s raining on the way back home. Arrived shortly before midnight.<br />

**06.10.2025** Returning from Can Tho in the afternoon. We measure the span width of the [Cần Thơ Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BA%A7n_Th%C6%A1_Bridge) while in the car with GPS for an average speed of 79 km/h and stop the time between the pillars to be 25 seconds. This gives us a distance of 548 meters, close to the actual 550 meters.
$$
distance = 79 \frac{km}{h} \times \frac{1000 m}{1 km} \times \frac{1h}{3600 s} \times 25 s = 548 ~ \mathrm{meter}
$$
**07.10.2025** Tuesday: I am leaving Vietnam for Cambodia to get my student visa processed. But it will be the afternoon when I arrive at the [Mộc Bài border crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%E1%BB%99c_B%C3%A0i), so the office at the Su Pham university is forwarding my papers only the next day to the immigration office. Now it's 6 working days to wait in Phnom Penh, starting with October 8th.<br />

**16.10.2025** Thursday morning: My invitation letter is there! After a coffee at Tube coffee I head to the embassy to deliver a printout of my documents. But it's not the simple **145 USD** fee for the 1-year multi-entry visa. For that you have to wait 5 business days until October 22nd. You can get it after "just" three working days on Monday for **165 USD**, or on this Thursday for **205 USD**. It should be written in Vietnamese in some circular that this 40% price increase is justified for this "express service" of a 5 minute printout work. Life in Phnom Penh has its costs, too. So I decide to wait until Monday as the most cost-effective option. The trip to Hanoi is coming up!<br />
17.10.2025<br />
18.10.2025<br />
19.10.2025<br />

### Finally my 1-year-visa
**20.10.2025** Monday morning I visit the embassy at 8:00 AM, right when they open. My visa should be prepared, I submitted the documents last Thursday already. But I will have to wait 2 more hours until I finally get my visa and can return to Vietnam!<br />
21.10.2025<br />
22.10.2025<br />
**23.10.2025** Thursday: It is time to repair the motorbike including several holes in the rear tire. It's actually 2 years old and has 20,000 km behind it! But it should last the next 5,000 km for the road trip to Hanoi.
### Start of the Second Road Trip to Hanoi
**24.10.2025** It is Friday morning, no time for breakfast. The motorbike is repaired, the holes in the tires are fixed, I am ready for the long planed second motorbike journey from Saigon to Hanoi: Part 1 is Saigon - Măng Đen 624.1 km, see [[Three day journey to Hanoi 2025]]<br />
**25.10.2025** Saturday is a day in the rain for the whole day. Therefore I only make it to Huế 420.2 km and join the weekend meeting on zoom.<br />
**26.10.2025** Sunday morning it is still raining in Hue, but after a few hours it stops when I arrive in Vinh. Sunset in Hanoi is at 18:00 and by 20:00 I am at [Hoàn Kiếm Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%C3%A0n_Ki%E1%BA%BFm_Lake) in Hà Nội after 650.4 km<br />

### First day as student
**27.10.2025** Monday: It is the first day of my study at the University of Education Ho Chi Minh City (*Trường Đại học Sư phạm TP. Hồ Chí Minh*) as a bachelor of Vietnamese Language and Culture of Vietnam (*Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hóa Việt Nam*). We have our meeting over Google Meet for 2 hours (since I am in **Hanoi**) and the first 5 students meet there, most for the first time. Two other students are **still in China** and are waiting for their visa. I added a page to my Obsidian vault under [[Official start of my study at Su Pham and Extension of a few projects]].

Later I was checking the weather, there should be sunshine in Sapa and Fansipan on Wednesday! It is a one day trip. Should I go there? I guess so. I checked out the location of the kingdom hall for the wedding on Friday, took a picture, visited [Vinhomes Times City in Hanoi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KHTbDE1ekrwPFhjV9), and parked at the McDonalds there. Special offer to get the coffee cheaper, continue digital planning for the next few days.<br />
### From Hanoi to Sapa 
**28.10.2025** Tuesday: It is too early for the Yamaha dealers in the city to open, and at 7:00 AM the streets are already packed and full of traffic jams. Let’s just leave the city and do the oil change later. Finally did it at [Yamaha Ba Vi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a3seJN7kZCywALND6), the Yamaha town a town earlier was moved and Google Maps not updated yet. As it turns out, the front fender is broken (one screw hole has the plastic broken out). And the brake pad is down to the metal and needs to be replaced. Didn’t I just replace it? Check my diary, it was 14.6.2023 - more than 2 years ago! Odo back then was just 13025 kilometers, we are now at 42477 km. And I need to change the ball bearings for the front wheel. Didn't I change this recently as well? Yes, December 2024 after the road trip around the Tonle Sap in Cambodia and a visit to Siem Reap and Battambang. Odo then 28035 km. Well, then let’s fix that! Including oil change for the motor and rear tire gearbox and labour just 500,000 VND or 16.30 Euro. It turned out to be a great preparation for Sapa (1400m) and the trail to Fansipan (1900m starting height) and the whole Ha Giang loop a week later. 

I arrived in **Lào Cai** at about 4:00 PM. On Google it states that the border crossing is closing at 5:00 PM, but this only applies for cars. You can walk there until 10:00 PM. Many Vietnamese get a 3 day tourist visa, valid for an area of 7 kilometers from the border gate. I get a 30 day visa exception for China and walk over to He Kou, visit [the train station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XGDCVtwRArgQBSex6) and downtown. Two hours later, I will return to Vietnam. With my multi-entry visa it is no problem, get the stamp and need only 15 minutes for the border crossing. Hekou on the other side has a special marking next to the border building as the “lowest southernmost point of China” with an elevation of only **76.2 meters**. My Apple watch confirms the height. It's dark already, some men watched my bike and got 10,000 VND. 

The climb to Sapa with my bike starts, a new bridge at 700 m height will make the journey easier soon. Sapa starts at 1300 metres and extends to 1450 meters. It’s another 12.5 kilometers or 23 minutes to the [Núi Xẻ Ranger Station Trạm Tôn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uc1wciUJPEJjfZ1JA) on **1900 meters**. Closed at night, can I start there tomorrow? 

Not without a guide, as explained during my stay at the [SAPA HUB hostel & trekking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T8cmQyjBusjgpjDLA) for 150,000 VND in the dormitory with a great buffet breakfast! Dropped my Apple Watch Series 6 in the shower, now the glass is broken. That’s the third Apple watch this year! It’s still working, but the fix at [Chiêm Tài](https://maps.app.goo.gl/akTEYgoJbXxxCBXT9) will be 400,000 VND on 2025-11-11. Actually 700,000 VND since the touch input layer has to be replaced as well. Still cheaper than Fenix 7 of my hike mates the next day. And it recorded 50% of the trail!
### Hiking to Fansipan up and down
**29.10.2025** Wednesday: I start the day relaxed with a breakfast 7:00 AM, then refill at the gas station. Check out the Núi Xẻ Ranger Station Trạm Tôn for a future tour at 9:00 AM, and yes - **you need a guide**!

Two South Africans are there and get their guide, so I join them for 1,200,000 VND. We start 9:30 and have great weather and conversations. Schutte Venter does Ultra Trails with 100 kilometers in 18 hours, and his wife is a similar fit. Good that they take the “old man” (me into consideration. 

Eventually it’s the 5th fastest time recorded on Strava, and I am completely exhausted. [Hitted the wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall) (bonking in biking) for me? 5:30 it got dark with sunset. We could still see a little, but used the flashlight from 6:30 to 7:30 when we finally arrived. Probably. 9:00 PM 

I'm not driving to Lào Cai but staying at the SAPA HUB hostel, I’m done. I was driving back with just 20 km/h and it took twice the time! The muscle pain stayed for another week! I could not take the stairs the normal way for the next 6 days.

### Returning to Hanoi
**30.10.2025** Thursday: Will I be able to visit the Trung Tam congregation in the evening? It was my plan, but as soon as I entered the house of Nhung's younger sister there was nowhere to go. I had a great time, though!
### Wedding of Ngọc Trâm and Thái 
**31.10.2025** Friday: Hanoi is a strange place. The streets are way to narrow for cars, but somehow you get a car and a motorbike passing on these narrow roads. And patiently everyone is moving at snails speed. While it simply won't stop raining. With the car we arrive dry and safe at the kingdom hall.

It is the official Wedding day of Ngọc Trâm and Thái Hanoi. Earlier the week was the ceremony at Tram's family house in Nha Trang, now it's the Kingdom Hall. And tomorrow it will be the at the house of the bridegroom.

## November 2025
### Second day of the wedding
**01.11.2025** Saturday: We have to drive to Long Bien to the home of Thai. In front of the house of his parents a large tent for 300 people is prepared. The invitation reads 11:00 am, but Tram wrote us already that times in the north are different, it starts at 10:00. And we can arrive earlier.

We actually arrive shortly after 9:00 and the place is already packed!
### The long journey from Hanoi to Lung Cu
**02.11.2025** Sunday: Initially I wanted to pick up Minh at the airport after she said farewell to her parents. But I meet with Markus for the first time for real in Hanoi, and before you know it's much later. It is still slightly raining, and I can't leave the family of Nhung's relatives without having a meal, and get things packed. Even after 3 days my long pants are not dry yet. But I have no option.

Since Minh want's to pick up a better helmet at her sister's house we meet there We start in Hanoi with rain at 3:00 pm. 1.5 hours later and outside of Hanoi the rain finally stops. But we have a long journey ahead, our homestay is in Lung Cu, the **northernmost point of Vietnam**! Google maps states 10 hours for the 429 km trip. But that's without breaks, rain, fog, and the cold temperatures in 1400m height on an unknown curvy road in darkness on pothole roads with a motorbike.

After 6 hours we arrive in **Hà Giang** at 9:00 pm and refill the Yamaha NVX. Some 150 kilometers left, but because of the terrain this should take us 4 hours. We would arrive at 1:00 am. Should we eat a little com and have a break? Or continue driving. We decide to continue driving. The motorbike might need energy, but we do not.

Leaving Hà Giang we decide to fill up the gas tank completely, since it is almost 10:00 pm. There might be gas stations on the way to Lung Cu, but they will probably be closed. Which turned out to be true, it was a good decision. And it started to rain again, while the temperature dropped as we gained height. At 11:00 pm we arrived at Cổng Trời Quản Bạ ([Quan Ba Heaven Gate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/54NbhTVuciF3RLhRA)) in 1400 meter height. The rain had stopped, but for the rest of the journey we would often be in clouds. The light would only shine some 20 meters, and the visor of the helmet would be constantly covered in mist.

Anyway, we were driving slowly enough to be save in the darkness. At 3:00 am on Monday we finally arrived at [Cột Cờ Lũng Cú](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k4iv8YQ4jyBQWqNq8). Nhưng and Cuồng were still awake and welcomed us with a hot Ginger tea. We were frozen and tired, but happy to have made the journey safe, even if it took 12 hours. And Nhưng renamed me to Thiên Sứ (angel) instead of Thiên Phú, since we did not eat and drink for 12 hours!

**05.11.2025** Wednesday, time to leave Ha Giang. But we start with a great sunrise:

**06.11.2025** I can't drive as far Quảng Ngãi 636.1 km, since a Typhoon is blocking my way.

![[2025-11-06_Kalmaegi.jpeg]]

**07.11.2025** Friday is a day driving through storm territory. Devastation wherever you look. Some roads are blocked by fallen trees for both lanes, only on the shoulder on one side can be used alternatively. This goes on for hours on the trip back to Saigon. Near Quy Nhon you see entire columns of trees toppled over on new developed areas. You see roofs lying on rice fields.

**08.11.2025** Circuit Assembly “*Hear What the Spirit Says to the Congregations*”. Two sisters get baptized in Thanh Đa.<br />
**09.11.2025** Circuit Assembly Vietnamese in Thanh Đa: “*Hãy nghe những gì thần khí nói với các hội thánh*”<br /><br />
### First in-person lesson at the university
**10.11.2025** Monday: The first time studying at Sư Phạm in person! The 15 minute drive takes 40 minutes, so a little later. Our lessons are 8:30 to 11:30, and our second teacher has an even longer journey from Nha Be. Our Korean student is missing this week. Hopefully next week we’re finally all together as a class in person! 4 students from China, and Phô Mai from Laos. With me we are 7 students from 4 nations. 

Meeting with Simon in the afternoon at Crescent Mall, and I realised the price range for professional sports watches from Garmin. My hiking partners at Fansipan had Fenix 7 watches, currently Fenix 8 is on sale for 31M VND or 1176 USD for the 51mm model (AMOLED, with MicroLED more 55M VND or 2049 USD). But it also has 29 days standby or 84 hours of GPS tracking, easily outpacing my Apple Watch. Should I upgrade? My broken watch is in repair for 700k because of the broken display from October 28th. 

Later I got a guided tour to the Climbing area by Simon. When is our climbing day? If you get the ticket 10-12 am it’s reduced to 210,000 VND for the whole day until 10 pm. Renting shoes is 50k, safety harness another 50k or a combo of 70k. Now I have to find a day to use this offer. Evening preparation for the midweek meeting. Currently we read the Song of Solomon or Canticles, and we listened to the audio recording with at least 5 different voices!

**11.11.2025 Tuesday**. Picked up my repaired Watch Series 6, and dropped two microphones at the KH. It is the only day with the lesson in the afternoon 13:00 to 16:00. <br />
12.11.2025<br />
**13.11.2025** Thursday: Next week is teachers day, on 2025-11-20. But some departments have the celebration on other days, our department [KHOA NGỮ VĂN](https://hcmue.edu.vn/vi/khoa-bo-mon/khoa-ngu-van) (Faculty of language and literature) is celebrating on Tuesday, November 18. So we’ll meet at 8:00 AM, and there is no afternoon lesson. The song the students sing for their students becomes our practice, and I make **24 mistakes** in the 13 lines putting the **correct tones** on the words. That’s how challenging the listening still is for me.<br />
### Wedding of Johnnie and Haylie
**14.11.2025** Friday: Finally another 5k run. Ready by 5:20, but only out at 5:35 with some fog. At least it is dry after the rain yesterday. Still with a pace over 6 minutes, but it’s been a while. Breakfast 35k with **Set Tỉnh Táo** (*Bánh mì ốp la* and *Pha Phin Cà Phê Sữa L* - previously Combo A lớn). I open my old **Sabbatical diary** - *a whole year is missing!* It needs to be synced with a future Obsidian vault, and some parts of multiple imports to a wordpress blog. The German parts from 2008 to 2010 probably need some translation. Until 11:00 AM we are already at November 2025 and update today! Got new fresh Arabica beans coffee from Sơn Nam, packed just today and originating from [Cầu Đất](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JN5spmVKk8Hi2Jtv7) ([The Coffee Farm Cầu Đất](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bRSVpWuRxvoGJkEZ7)) near Dalat (38 minutes, 24 km) for now 380,000 VND/kg. 

With Simon we’ll leave at 2:00 to be on time at the KH for Johnnie and Haylie’s wedding. They have [a great story](https://www.theknot.com/us/haylie-chu-and-johnnie-phan-2025-11-14/our-story), compiled for the internet.<br />

### Circuit assembly in Xuân Trường
**06.12.2025** Saturday: The south-eastern congregations like Nha Trang have their assembly in [Xuân Trường](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vVLzTCCPmQeXC4CC7) at the connected kingdom halls. According to Google Maps 2h39 for 101km with a two-wheeler (my NVX). Start early at 6:00 with breakfast, drive from 6:30 to 9:09 and get ready before the program starts with music at 9:40 for “[Hear What the Spirit Says to the Congregations](https://www.jw.org/en/library/programs/2025-2026-Circuit-Assembly-Program-With-Branch-Representative/Hear-What-the-Spirit-Says-to-the-Congregations/)”.<br />
### Visit to Trảng Bàng
**07.12.2025** Sunday: A week ago I was invited by Xương and Linh to visit them at their congregation , since Xuong is giving a talk. That's my journey on this Sunday, and we spend time together until the afternoon. The [new kingdom hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q7hf8jaVtphUPDxN8) is already 3 years old. But only a month ago the 4 air conditioners were installed - and it's a big difference! Prior to that it was rather hot, you hear the dogs barking from outside, or neighbours with their Karaoke. Now you can easily focus on your study.

We also visit the house of Xương and Linh in Trảng Bàng. They do not switch on the A/C (real Asians) and have only 150,000 VND for electricity. Rent? Some 1.2tr and they don't even use the "second floor", a kind of mezzanine above the kitchen and bathroom. Maybe I should move out of the city. Even the visa run to Cambodia would be shorter!<br />

### Journey to Núi Bà Đen
**12.12.2025** Friday: The Black Virgin Mountain (*núi Bà Đen*) is only 2.5 hours away from the Su Pham university. My lesson finishes at 11:30, so I could be there at 14:00. I finally decide to eat lunch first, so I leave at 12:10 and arrive at 14:30. Which is a little too late, the guard for the easy hiking trail won't let anyone hike up the mountain after 14:00. Without a break it takes 2 hours to get to the top. I would arrive there at 16:00 or later, and still have to buy a ticket down.

<img src="Diary/files/2025-12-12_Nui_Ba_Den_1.jpg" width="43%"> <img src="Diary/files/2025-12-12_Nui_Ba_Den_2.jpg" width="54%">

The temple and tourist area on top of the mountain has been expanded by the Sun group, one can spend some time there. It is a little too much for my schedule today. I enter the area for 10k VND and walk to the different pagoda's that are constructed at the lower part of the mountain at 200 to 300 meter height. There are 3 cable cars from the bottom to this area (only the **Chùa Hang** one works), another new one connects to the top of the mountain (**Hòa Đồng** to **Tâm An**). And the direct connection is from **Nhà Ga Bà Đen station** to **Vân Sơn** at 986 meters.

<img src="Diary/files/2025-12-12_Nui_Ba_Den_3.jpg" width="65%"> <img src="Diary/files/2025-12-12_Nui_Ba_Den_4.jpg" width="32%">

There is an old path up to the mountain with stairs all the way up to 350 meters. Even the guard rails next to the stairs have been painted in yellow recently. But some upper sections have been washed away, and only a boulder trail remains. At 400 meters height it is more and more overgrown, and increasing in difficulty. The heat map on Strava shows that very few continue this path. It might be an option for another day. Above 750 meters the trail from the top becomes more visible again on Strava. But what about the section in between?<br />
**13.12.2025** Saturday: Visit of Thiên Phú to our congregation! The public talk is , but there are also 5 points to consider for each of us:<br />
**14.12.2025** Sunday: My second time Pickle Ball. This time no fever, and no significant back pain. At least I don't need Paracetamol.<br />

**15.12.2025** It is time to make progress in this [[Obsidian]] vault. Now over 12,000 words and a total of 46 minutes to read. I still have to figure out a good way to structure the [[My Diary|diary]] in a visually pleasing way. Probably a few pictures will make it much nicer, and a paragraph per day should be sufficient. The Daily notes should be included into the Blog, then it is only 5 categories.<br />

**21.12.2025** We get our new fridge Toshiba Inverter 233 lít GR-RT303WE-PMV(52)! The old LG was broken for 5 months now, and I rarely used it anyway, since it needed some 2.4 kWh every day. The new one has two inverters (for the compressor and fan on the expansion side) and needs only 1/3 of the energy compared to the old LG GR-212DL! And it has 21 liters more space, while the convection oven for pizza still fits above it.<br />

The test at 13:30 shows: I need to work on my pronunciation (phát âm). It's exactly how Ben told me 9 years ago: "Get the tones right"! After 1h30 we're all finished, and go as a group (without Phô Mai) to [Kichi Kichi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ST1VRU1RcWbq4N29A) at the [Vạn Hạnh Mall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6R3AjDLMSz8941p6A)near our university.
