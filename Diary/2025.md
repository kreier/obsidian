## September 2025

**1.9.2025** Monday, the start of a new service year! In service with Hiếu in Nha Trang. Walking on the railroad tracks like in India, talking to a woman on the bridge. Are her prayers answered when burning money? Don’t know yet, it’s the first time! Evening at the [Armenian restaurant in Nha Trang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y2QXzwWatpHVr2yS7) with friends.  

**2.9.2025** Tuesday is Independence day of Vietnam and this year is a big celebration in Vietnam since it’s now 50 years. Fireworks in Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh, but it’s raining on the way back home. Arrived shortly before midnight.

### 2025-10-27 Monday in Hanoi and first day as student
It is the first day of my study at the University of Education Ho Chi Minh City (Trường Đại học Sư phạm TP. Hồ Chí Minh) as a bachelor of Vietnamese Language and Culture of Vietnam (Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hóa Việt Nam). We have our meeting over Google Meet for 2 hours and the first 5 students meet there, most for the first time. Two other students are still in China and are waiting for their visa. I added a page to my Obsidian vault under [https://saiht.de/obsidian/Daily-notes/2025-10-27-Extend-projects](https://saiht.de/obsidian/Daily-notes/2025-10-27-Extend-projects). 

Later I was checking the weather, there should be sunshine in Sapa and Fansipan on Wednesday! It is a one day trip. Should I go there? I guess so. I checked out the location of the kingdom hall for the wedding on Friday, took a picture, visited [Vinhomes Times City in Hanoi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KHTbDE1ekrwPFhjV9), and parked at the McDonalds there. Special offer to get the coffee cheaper, continue digital planning for the next few days.

### 2025-10-28 Tuesday from Hanoi to Sapa 
It is too early for the Yamaha dealers in the city to open, and at 7:00 AM the streets are already packed and full of traffic jams. Let’s just leave the city and do the oil change later. Finally did it at [Yamaha Ba Vi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a3seJN7kZCywALND6), the Yamaha town a town earlier was moved and Google Maps not updated yet. As it turns out, the front fender is broken (one screw hole has the plastic broken out). And the brake pad is down to the metal and needs to be replaced. Didn’t I just replace it? Check my diary, it was 14.6.2023 - more than 2 years ago! Odo back then was just 13025 kilometers, we are now at 42477 km. And I need to change the ball bearings for the front wheel. Didn't I change this recently as well? Yes, December 2024 after the road trip around the Tonle Sap in Cambodia and a visit to Siem Reap and Battambang. Odo then 28035 km. Well, then let’s fix that! Including oil change for the motor and rear tire gearbox and labour just 500,000 VND or 16.30 Euro. It turned out to be a great preparation for Sapa (1400m) and the trail to Fansipan (1900m starting height) and the whole Ha Giang loop a week later. 

I arrived in **Lào Cai** at about 4:00 PM. On Google it states that the border crossing is closing at 5:00 PM, but this only applies for cars. You can walk there until 10:00 PM. Many Vietnamese get a 3 day tourist visa, valid for an area of 7 kilometers from the border gate. I get a 30 day visa exception for China and walk over to He Kou, visit [the train station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XGDCVtwRArgQBSex6) and downtown. Two hours later, I will return to Vietnam. With my multi-entry visa it is no problem, get the stamp and need only 15 minutes for the border crossing. Hekou on the other side has a special marking next to the border building as the “lowest southernmost point of China” with an elevation of only **76.2 meters**. My Apple watch confirms the height. It's dark already, some men watched my bike and got 10,000 VND. 

The climb to Sapa with my bike starts, a new bridge at 700 m height will make the journey easier soon. Sapa starts at 1300 metres and extends to 1450 meters. It’s another 12.5 kilometers or 23 minutes to the [Núi Xẻ Ranger Station Trạm Tôn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uc1wciUJPEJjfZ1JA) on **1900 meters**. Closed at night, can I start there tomorrow? 

Not without a guide, as explained during my stay at the [SAPA HUB hostel & trekking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T8cmQyjBusjgpjDLA) for 150,000 VND in the dormitory with a great buffet breakfast! Dropped my Apple Watch Series 6 in the shower, now the glass is broken. That’s the third Apple watch this year! It’s still working, but the fix at [Chiêm Tài](https://maps.app.goo.gl/akTEYgoJbXxxCBXT9) will be 400,000 VND on 2025-11-11. Actually 700,000 VND since the touch input layer has to be replaced as well. Still cheaper than Fenix 7 of my hike mates the next day. And it recorded 50% of the trail!

### 2025-10-29 Wednesday - Hiking to Fansipan up and down
I start the day relaxed with a breakfast 7:00 AM, then refill at the gas station. Check out the Núi Xẻ Ranger Station Trạm Tôn for a future tour at 9:00 AM, and yes - **you need a guide**!

Two South Africans are there and get their guide, so I join them for 1,200,000 VND. We start 9:30 and have great weather and conversations. Schutte Venter does Ultra Trails with 100 kilometers in 18 hours, and his wife is a similar fit. Good that they take the “old man” (me into consideration. 

Eventually it’s the 5th fastest time recorded on Strava, and I am completely exhausted. [Hitted the wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall) (bonking in biking) for me? 5:30 it got dark with sunset. We could still see a little, but used the flashlight from 6:30 to 7:30 when we finally arrived. Probably. 9:00 PM 

I'm not driving to Lào Cai but staying at the SAPA HUB hostel, I’m done. I was driving back with just 20 km/h and it took twice the time! The muscle pain stayed for another week! I could not take the stairs the normal way for the next 6 days.

### 2025-10-30 Thursday - Returning to Hanoi. 
Will I be able to visit the Trung Tam congregation in the evening? It was my plan, but …

### 2025-10-31 Friday - Wedding of Ngọc Trâm and Thái 
It is the Wedding day of Ngọc Trâm and Thái Hanoi.

## November 2025
### 2025-11-01 Saturday - Second day of the wedding
We have to drive to Long Bien to the home of Thai. In front of the house of his parents a large tent for 300 people is prepared. The invitation reads 11:00 am, but Tram wrote us already that times in the north are different, it starts at 10:00. And we can arrive earlier.

We actually arrive shortly after 9:00 and the place is aready packed!
### 2025-11-02 The long journey from Hanoi to Lung Cu
I have to extend this later. Minh and I start in Hanoi with rain at 3:00 pm. 1.5 hours later and outside of Hanoi the rain finally stops. But we have a long journey ahead, our homestay is in Lung Cu, the **northernmost point of Vietnam**! Google maps states 10 hours for the 429 km trip. But that's without breaks, rain, fog, and the cold temperatures in 1400m height on an unknown curvy road in darkness on pothole roads with a motorbike.

After 6 hours we arrive in **Hà Giang** at 9:00 pm and refill the Yamaha NVX. Some 150 kilometers left, but because of the terrain this should take us 4 hours. We would arrive at 1:00 am. Should we eat a little com and have a break? Or continue driving. We decide to continue driving. The motorbike might need energy, but we do not.

Leaving Hà Giang we decide to fill up the gas tank completely, since it is almost 10:00 pm. There might be gas stations on the way to Lung Cu, but they will probably be closed. Which turned out to be true, it was a good decision. And it started to rain again, while the temperature dropped as we gained height. At 11:00 pm we arrived at Cổng Trời Quản Bạ ([Quan Ba Heaven Gate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/54NbhTVuciF3RLhRA)) in 1400 meter height. The rain had stopped, but for the rest of the journey we would often be in clouds. The light would only shine some 20 meters, and the visor of the helmet would be constantly covered in mist.

Anyway, we were driving slowly enough to be save in the darkness. At 3:00 am on Monday we finally arrived at [Cột Cờ Lũng Cú](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k4iv8YQ4jyBQWqNq8). Nhưng and Cuồng were still awake and welcomed us with a hot Ginger tea. We were frozen and tired, but happy to have made the journey safe, even if it took 12 hours. And Nhưng renamed me to Thiên Sứ (angel) instead of Thiên Phú, since we did not eat and drink for 12 hours!

### 2025-11-10 Monday - First in-person lesson at the university
The first time studying at Sư Phạm in person! The 15 minute drive takes 40 minutes, so a little later. Our lessons are 8:30 to 11:30, and our second teacher has an even longer journey from Nha Be. Our Korean student is missing this week. Hopefully next week we’re finally all together as a class in person! 4 students from China, and Phô Mai from Laos. With me we are 7 students from 4 nations. 

Meeting with Simon in the afternoon at Crescent Mall, and I realised the price range for professional sports watches from Garmin. My hiking partners at Fansipan had Fenix 7 watches, currently Fenix 8 is on sale for 31M VND or 1176 USD for the 51mm model (AMOLED, with MicroLED more 55M VND or 2049 USD). But it also has 29 days standby or 84 hours of GPS tracking, easily outpacing my Apple Watch. Should I upgrade? My broken watch is in repair for 700k because of the broken display from October 28th. 

Later I got a guided tour to the Climbing area by Simon. When is our climbing day? If you get the ticket 10-12 am it’s reduced to 210,000 VND for the whole day until 10 pm. Renting shoes is 50k, safety harness another 50k or a combo of 70k. Now I have to find a day to use this offer. Evening preparation for the midweek meeting. Currently we read the Song of Solomon or Canticles, and we listened to the audio recording with at least 5 different voices!

**11.11.2025 Tuesday**. Picked up my repaired Watch Series 6, and dropped two microphones at the KH. It is the only day with the lesson in the afternoon 13:00 to 16:00. 

12.11.2025 Wednesday

### 2025-11-13 Thursday
Next week is teachers day, on 2025-11-20. But some departments have the celebration on other days, our department [KHOA NGỮ VĂN](https://hcmue.edu.vn/vi/khoa-bo-mon/khoa-ngu-van) (Faculty of language and literature) is celebrating on Tuesday, November 18. So we’ll meet at 8:00 AM, and there is no afternoon lesson. The song the students sing for their students becomes our practice, and I make **24 mistakes** in the 13 lines putting the **correct tones** on the words. That’s how challenging the listening still is for me.

### 2025-11-14 Friday - Wedding of Johnnie and Haylie
Finally another 5k run. Ready 5:20, but only out at 5:35 with some fog, but dry after the rain yesterday. Still over 6 minute pace, but it’s been a while. Breakfast 35k with Set Tỉnh Táo (Bánh mì ốp la and Pha Phin Cà Phê Sữa L - previously Combo A lớn). Open the Sabbatical diary - a whole year is missing! It needs to be synced with a future Obsidian vault, and some parts of multiple imports to a wordpress blog. The German parts from 2008 to 2010 probably need some translation. Until 11:00 AM we are already at November 2025 and update today! Got new fresh Arabica beans coffee from Sơn Nam, packed just today and originating from [Cầu Đất](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JN5spmVKk8Hi2Jtv7) ([The Coffee Farm Cầu Đất](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bRSVpWuRxvoGJkEZ7)) near Dalat (38 minutes, 24 km) for now 380,000 VND/kg. 

With Simon we’ll leave at 2:00 to be on time at the KH for Johnnie and Haylie’s wedding. They have [a great story](https://www.theknot.com/us/haylie-chu-and-johnnie-phan-2025-11-14/our-story), compiled for the internet.

### 2025-12-06 Saturday convention in Xuân Trường
