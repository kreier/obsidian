**2.6.2023** 
I promised at Wayne's café in Crescent mall to reactivate this project until the end of June 2023. A review of old files with horizontal alignment showed, that I need 600 columns for divisions of 10 years each. Now I start a new edition 90 degree rotated in Google docs.

**4.6.2023** I did some reasoning about layout and took notes in iPhone notes. It's about scale, orientation (horizontal versus vertical) and a more precise vector design.

**10.6.2023** The GitHub repository was opened: [https://github.com/kreier/timeline](https://github.com/kreier/timeline) . It marks the official beginning of the [[Timeline]] project in 2023. Digital started already 2009, see more at the project.

**18.6.2023** Is it better not to use a Jupyter notebook but directly export to PDF with a point size of 1/72 inch or 0.3527 mm?

**19.6.2023** The first page is translated: [https://github.com/kreier/timeline/blob/main/spreadsheet/Timeline_3A4_2023.pdf](https://github.com/kreier/timeline/blob/main/spreadsheet/Timeline_3A4_2023.pdf)

**24.6.2023** The second page translated. I created some CSV files for the relevant data points. 

**30.6.2023** The second page is finished and exported as pdf as [version 1.1](https://github.com/kreier/timeline/releases/tag/v1.1): https://github.com/kreier/timeline/releases/download/v1.1/Timeline_20231017.pdf
