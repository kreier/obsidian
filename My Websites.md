Over the years I created a few websites. And in time I had to consolidate some, and save the content in a subfolder for documentation. My goal of 2025 is to have only [saiht.de](https://saiht.de) available for personal information and [kreier.org](https://kreier.org) for work related information and projects.
## Current Domains - 3 are still alive
### [[saiht.de]] 1999-2026
This continues to be my personal Website. I started in 1999 with a few pages in German, and used frames to separate the navigation from the content. This approach is long deprecated, have a look at the current version [saiht.de](https://saiht.de) 

And some information has been stored in the dedicated page [[saiht.de]] here in obsidian.
### [[kreier.org]] 2018-2026
With my new job at AISVN I started to create my own website to provide student material for my IB Physics course. In the end this turned out to be very time consuming!

Some details about the creation are written at [[kreier.org]]. And the current iteration at [https://kreier.org](https://kreier.org).
### [[people.physik.hu-berlin.de-kreier]] 2000-2026
This webspace is provided by my university. And since it is hosted in the **Institutrechenzentrum** with some ultrafast fibre internet connection (we do research, after all) this should serve all my purposes well. A little more background at [[people.physik.hu-berlin.de-kreier]].

Not much has changed since 2008 here: [people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/](https://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/).

Here is the list of websites I owned over the years.
## Historic Domains
- **lacy.de** 2000-2003 [backup](https://saiht.de/x/lacy) It was intended to be a combined site with some friends.
- **saiht.net** 2002-2004 just a test, [backup saiht.de/x/saihtnet](https://saihtl.de/x/saihtnet)
- [[saiht.org]] was a project 2008-2025. I used it in 2010 for the SDW with WordPress, but it was never really used.
