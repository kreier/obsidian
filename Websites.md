Over the years I created a few websites. And in time I had to consolidate some, and save the content in a subfolder for documentation. My goal of 2025 is to have only [saiht.de](https://saiht.de) available for personal information and [kreier.org](https://kreier.org) for work related information and projects.
## Domains
Here is the list of websites I owned over the years.
### [saiht.de](https://saiht.de) 1999-2025
This continues to be my personal Website. I started in 1999 with a few pages in German, and used frames to separate the navigation from the content. This approach is long deprecated, but more can be seen in the dedicated page [[saiht.de]] here in obsidian.
## [[kreier.org]] 2018-2025
With my new job at AISVN I started to create my own website to provide student material for my IB Physics course. In the end this turned out to be very time consuming!

people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/

- **lacy.de** 2000-2003 [backup]()
It was intended to be a combined site with some friends.
