From October 2000 to March 2008 I studied Physics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. After defending my thesis I received a "**Diploma of Physics**". Today that's viewed equal to a masters degree. The bachelor and master program was not yet offered when I started to study.
## Prerequesits
The German educational system requires you to have an "Abitur" to be eligble to study at a university. Usually this is obtained as a high school diploma after 13 years. In some states only 12 years are required, or a fast track option is available. My case in the early 90s was different, my grade level was the first to go from 12 to 13 years. While I like learning, these extra 3 years did not appear worthwhile, so I started my vocational training as a **Kommunikationselektroniker Fachrichtung Telekommunikationstechnik** at the Deutsche Telekom Potsdam in September 1992.

Fast forward to 2000. After working for 5 years at the Deutsche Telekom I want to study at a university. In August 2000 my **Zivildienst** at the **Berliner Feuerwehr** (Firefighters Berlin) finally starts. My goal over the next year is to use the free time to get my Abitur. 
## Challenging first semesters
Why is the derivative of $x^3$ simply $3x^2$ - how would you know that? Well, if you skip 3 years of high school and calculus, you probably have no clue. Neither did I. The first 2 years was a catch up on all the topics that I missed. Which made me feel as if the others always would know more.

The cutoff line for most exams was 50%. Usually 30% of the students score below. Starting with more than 100 students this lead to an exponential decay in student numbers. Somehow I managed to always be slightly above the failing group.
## Writing software
I had started writing software in Basic in the 80s. The early 90s I learned C for my Atari STFM 520. For Physics we learned Mathematica and $\LaTeX$. It was another good motivation to start with C and C++ again. I still have my first cpp program [Integralberechnung.cc](https://saiht.de/legacy/physik/program/Integralberechnung.cc).

In 2006 I started to work on my diploma thesis. To visualize and manipulate our data I wrote a program in Java. I tried to follow the motto "Write once - run anywhere". And it is true, to a degree. Now in 2026, 18 years later, it still functions and looks like intended. It's named [[ar65view]].
