A General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit ([[GPGPU]]) is a GPU that has additional features to use the large parallel processing power of a GPU for other purposes than rendering graphics. It became useful for machine learning and neuronal networks.
## AlexNet
One breakthrough application was the use of GPUs for image classification with [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) in 2016. It significantly increased the accuracy in the [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet "ImageNet") Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). And the [[Nvidia]] GPUs were programmed with [[CUDA]].
