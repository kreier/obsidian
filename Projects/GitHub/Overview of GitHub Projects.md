This is another attempt to structure and list all of my projects on GitHub. Currently (2025/12/15) I have [170 repositories](https://github.com/kreier?tab=repositories) on GitHub. In Summer 2020 I tried a structured Website with links and images at [kreier.github.io](https://kreier.github.io/) and documented at least 32 projects plus some forks. My categories from 2020 are:

- Science 6
- Software 4
- Robotics 11
- School projects 9
- Movies and History 2
- Unintentionally forked 5
- kreier.github.io 1

Here my new attempt from early 2026:

## History
### Timeline - https://kreier.github.io/timeline/

Repository on and website at https://kreier.github.io/timeline/
![Timeline 2025](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kreier/timeline/refs/heads/main/docs/timeline20250925_5.9.png)

This project started as an html version already in **2006**. In **2009** it went physical for three A4 papers in landscape, created with OpenOffice. By **2015** the temporal resolution was much improved with a digital vector drawing in OpenOffice Draw, but the creation process was too cumbersome that only 24 persons, 2 time periods and 3 event dates were entered. In June 2023 the first English translation of the 2009 project was finished.

By **October 2023** the foundation for the current edition was laid with a python program generating a PDF document from a number of `.csv`-lists. Over the next years the content was extended, pictures included and new languages translated.

There are two related projects to hold the generated PDF files, linked with the QR code embedded in each timeline:

### Tripitaka
Repository at [https://github.com/kreier/tripitaka](https://github.com/kreier/tripitaka) and website at [https://kreier.github.io/tripitaka/](https://kreier.github.io/tripitaka/)
Living here in Asia I have some contact to the Buddhist religion. If the Bible is the foundation for Christian religions, where can we find the teachings of Buddha? I tried to quantize the writings of the Tripitaka and compare it to the Bible, hence this project.

Here the short result: The three baskets have 2782 books and 5273 chapters that could be printed on **7013 pages**. The Bible has 66 books with 1189 chapters that in the KJV could be printed on **1062 pages**. The Tripitaka is therefore roughly **6.6x as large**. Not that many people actually read the content of the baskets and Pitaka's.
