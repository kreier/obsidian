In 2018 I was visiting Myanmar. My journey also took me to the [largest book of the world with 729 tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripi%E1%B9%ADaka_tablets_at_Kuthodaw_Pagoda) in Mandalay. And living in Asia since 2016 you meet the Buddhist faith in many areas. My first visit to Asia in 1998 (Thailand and Malaysia) brought me into direct contact with this religion.
## Motivation
I want to get some statistics on the text of the Tripitaka and probably make it searchable for phrases. Then compare the results to the Bible. Here the short result: The three baskets have 2782 books and **5273 chapters** that could be printed on **7013 pages**. The Bible has 66 books with **1189 chapters** that in the kjv could be printed on **1062 pages**. The Tripitaka is therefore roughly **6.6x** as large.
