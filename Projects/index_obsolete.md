## 2016
- 2016-2017 **Treehouse** in Saigon at the International German School Ho Chi Minh City. The school moved to a new location in 2025, so this is a past project. See [[Saigon treehouse]].
## 2013
- 2013-2016 **Treehouse** in Hofkoh. This was fun, even my students from Scheeßel came to visit to have their part in building it! Unfortunately the storm in October 2025 was too strong for the old willow tree, so it crashed. See [[Hofkoh treehouse]].
