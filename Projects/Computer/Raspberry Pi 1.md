I'm sure I got this in 2013. I have been using it in class to show videos at the Gymnasium Warstade in Hemoor. It's still running in 2026. I brought it with me to Saigon. It is the first edition, but already "upgraded" to 256 MB RAM. And it has the Coax video output. I actually used this to drive small 7" displays. And for some Youtube videos in a loop it just worked fine.
