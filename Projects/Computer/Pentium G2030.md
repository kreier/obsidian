While tutoring I was asked by my student about the viability of Cryptocurrency and crypto mining. I had heard about it in 2008 and didn't pay much attention back then. Several other attempts like "webcoin" had crashed or gotten nowhere - why should Bitcoin be different?

I soon realized that in 2021 with a CPU you could still generate income, and I had a RX470 with 4 GB lying around. I got it for Machine Learning in 2018 and it was cheap because the crypto boom 2016/2017 was over. Well, here we are 3 years later. 4 GB is a tough limit for DAG size, but I will learn this later.
## Dedicated mining machine
Prior to a dedicated machine I was just using my old [[HP Z600 Workstation]] with the RX470 in it. But the Dual-Xeon consumes a lot of power, and I want to work as well, not just mine coins. So I got an old mainboard with CPU, cooler and 4 GB of DDR3 RAM for 1m VND or $40.
## OS: HiveOS
Instead of starting from an SSD or HDD I started from a USB flash drive. Once it is started the main workload is transferred to the GPU and it just keeps crunching numbers.
