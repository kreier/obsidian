This is my personal website since 1999.
## Current structure
I have a landing page that leads to the 4 categories blog ([[My Blog]]), travel and projects ([[Projects overview]]).
### Blog
This will take some time to finish. Maybe it's not wise to write your own MarkDown parser. Let's see.
### Travel
As seen in the [[sitemap]] attempt from 2007 with already 15 pages dedicated to traveling, this will take a considerable amount of time to actually make a good documentation. I probably need a good interface for editing. Instagram makes it easier with the pictures, but even there we don't post all pictures of all travels.
### Projects
Again, my old [[sitemap]] from 2007 lists already **15 projects**. In 2020 I tried to organize and categorize my then **38 projects** on GitHub, see [https://kreier.github.io/](https://kreier.github.io/). Today I say: "nice try". Currently (October 2025) I have [169 repositories](https://github.com/kreier?tab=repositories). And I don't think, I'm slowing down.
## History
### 1999 A small start
I conserved this content in the legacy folder. You can see it at [first.saiht.de](http://first.saiht.de) or [https://saiht.de/legacy/computer/first/index.html](https://saiht.de/legacy/computer/first/index.html). It was a humble start.
### 2004 Becoming black and white
Some people actually started to read my page, and had questions about some of the content. So I simplified it and took parts off, made it black and white: 
### 2007 Sitemap
Organizing the content is an ongoing struggle. Here is my [[sitemap]] from 2007 in an attempt to have the main 58 pages plus the 20 subdomains mainly complete.
### 2025 Creating a dedicated /blog folder
The idea is in my head for a long time, and some programming started in 2024. Why not write the articles in a timeless MarkDown document with title, headings, subheadings, images and **LaTeX** formulas, and then convert it automatically by a python program to a static html page that is accessible over the saiht.de/blog webpage? Over time things like search, tags and others can be implemented.
