This is my personal website since 1999.
## Current structure
I have a landing page that leads to the 4 categories blog, travel and projects.
## History
### 1999 Small start
I conserved this content in the legacy folder. You can see it at [first.saiht.de](http://first.saiht.de) or [https://saiht.de/legacy/computer/first/index.html](https://saiht.de/legacy/computer/first/index.html). It was a humble start.
### 2004 Becoming black and white
Some people actually started to read my page, and had questions about some of the content. So I simplified it and took parts off, made it black and white: 
### 2025 Creating a dedicated /blog folder
The idea is in my head for a long time, and some programming started in 2024. Why not write the articles in a timeless MarkDown document with title, headings, subheadings, images and LaTeX formulas, and then convert it automatically by a python program to a static html page that is accessable over the saiht.de/blog webpage? Over time things like search, tags and others can be implemented.
