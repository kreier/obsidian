It’s been a while in my path of organized note taking apps. I installed [Notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(productivity_software)in **November 2023**, then again in **October 2024** when we visited Peter in Da Nang. It looks nice and has many features as a commercial product, but since using GitHub since 2018 I liked the idea of Markdown and Open source very much.

So I installed [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)) on my iPhone on November 21rd, 2024, during my visa run to Cambodia. And I made my first entry with my iPad. But the question of syncing took another year to finally find a fitting repository.

Then finally, on October 21st, 2025, this whole project was reactivated.
