I might have to use a folder.

And I can make lists:
- First Point
- Second point

But is it like a Jupyter Notebook and can execute python as well?

Let’s link the other two pages I created first. So there is  [[A humble beginning]] which is my first document. And then there is [[Note the second]] that is already moved to a subfolder.

The left menu lets you automatically create a document that has the current date as title. So I accidentally created [[2024-11-21]] today. Well, that’s how it goes.
