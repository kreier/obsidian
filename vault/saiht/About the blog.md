From time to time I just want to document an **activity**, **insight** or **research result** that does not belong any of the other categories. So I write a blog article about it. Possible other documentations are:

- [[My Projects]] is for bigger endeavours, usually documented on GitHub
- [[My Diary]] has only short notes about each day in a year
- [[Travel history]] about journeys, places I've been and people I've met
- [[Leisure]] for shorter trips or good times with friends at nearby places
- [[My Websites]] might actually have copies of the articles below. It sometimes depends where I start to write first, or if I translate an older German article to English. There is for example the website [saiht.de/blog](https://saiht.de/blog)   

The long term goal is to have hopefully one day **one** cohesive project made from a combination of a digital diary, blog, several To-do lists and a log file into.
## 2025
- [[Quartz 4 and GitHub for notes with Obsidian]] Restart blogging with GitHub backup and Quartz v4 publishing.
- 2025-10-20 With WordPress to the rescue I tried a canvas of my new WordPress over Tethering install while waiting for my visa at the Vietnamese embassy. Competed in Saigon in the evening, FileZilla made it happen! Canvas is not supported by quartz, so it got removed.
## 2024
- 2024-12-19 [[Writing pages in Obsidian]] With a new daily note in Cambodia I started to fill my vault with a little linked content.
- 2024-11-21 [[A humble beginning 2024]] is a new start with Obsidian.
