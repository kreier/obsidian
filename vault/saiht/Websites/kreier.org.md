In 2017 I started working at the **AISVN** American International School Vietnam. Soon I found that IB Physics material was hosted on tes.com servers, but a different company bought it and was about to shut down the content. Google products don't work in China.

My idea was to host come of this content on my own website, so I bought kreier.org and started hosting the first pages. I never finished chapter 1, it takes a lot of time. But the layout got better over time, and in 2025 I finally reactivated it. By then I had learned more about the automatic generation of websites from Markdown files with tools like Jekyll and Quartz for Obsidian.

I taught this course from 2022 to 2023 at SSIS. It was one of my favorite courses, even though only 4 students were in class. We learned all a lot, and covered so many different topics. Machine learning is one of the 6 topics, and in December 2022 the world was taken by storm with ChatGPT by OpenAI. The influence of LLMs and AI shaped the following years!
