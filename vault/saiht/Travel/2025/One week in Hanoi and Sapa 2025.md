On October 26th evening I arrived in Hanoi after the [[Three day journey to Hanoi 2025]]. I found a cheap place to stay for two nights, since Monday was reserved for my first day of study, and I wanted to have a place to return to in the evening. Yet Tuesday I could be back on the road to another journey, or extend my stay. Planning started Monday afternoon.
## 10-27 First day of study - Hà Nội 30.1 km
It Monday, the first day of my study at the University of Education Ho Chi Minh City (**Trường Đại học Sư phạm TP. Hồ Chí Minh**) as a bachelor of Vietnamese Language and Culture of Vietnam (**Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hóa Việt Nam**). We have our meeting over Google Meet for 2 hours and the first 5 students meet there, most for the first time. Two other students are still in China and are waiting for their visa.
## 10-28 Trip to **Lào Cai**, China and Sapa 369.9 km
I arrived in **Lào Cai** at about 4:00 PM. On Google it states that the border crossing is closing at 5:00 PM, but this only applies for cars. You can walk there until 10:00 PM. Many Vietnamese get a 3 day tourist visa, valid for an area of 7 kilometers from the border gate. I get a 30 day visa exception for China and walk over to He Kou, visit [the train station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XGDCVtwRArgQBSex6) and downtown. Two hours later, I will return to Vietnam. 
## 10-29 Fansipan 21.1 km
It is a sunny day, as predicted on Monday.
## 10-30 Return to Hà Nội 385.4 km
Nhung's family invited me to stay at their place. Immediately I was involved with the family, no time to "just leave" for the English meeting, or visit the central congregation
## 10-31 Wedding of Thai and Tram 0 km
Nhung's sister is taking us to the KH with her car, so we're not bothered by the rain. Dỉnh has an encouraging talk for the new couple. After that we enjoy the company of all the guests with some good food.
## 11-01 Wedding part II in Hung Yen 50 km
It's slightly raining again on this Satuday. The second wedding part at Thai's parents house is supposed to start at 11:00 AM. Trâm sent a message that we should start earlier in the North, at 10:00 AM. But we can already arrive at 9:00 AM, which we do. And the party is already in full swing!

Actually it is the third part, since the first party was in Nha Trang earlier this week at the house of Trâm's parents. The guests enjoyed the two days there very much, see the reel on Jesse's Instagram account!

The afternoon we went to Thai and Trâm's apartment, rested a little, joined the Phan Thiet congregation over zoom and then had a good time together. For a few months there is a Hmong group in Hanoi, and it has 13 publishers - one brother, 12 sisters. Three of these young sisters are with us and share some encouraging  experiences of their bible students.

Our Ha Giang group is leaving this evening with the bus. I stay another night in Hanoi and will pick up Minh at the airport the next day. That's the plan, anyways.
## 11-02 Finally meeting Markus
I live in Vietnam since 2016, as does Markus. How is it, that we only meet by chance in August 2025 in Quy Nhon? Well, Hanoi and Saigon are far apart. We don't travel to either city very often. This morning we have a coffee together at asdf near the [Hồ Hoàn Kiếm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%C3%A0n_Ki%E1%BA%BFm_Lake). I can drive my bike through the store to the backyard, and we head for the third floor. Nine years in Vietnam gave us a lot of things to talk about.

We figured out that in fall of 2010 we were at the same time in the Bethel in Selters, Germany. But with more than 1000 people around us we did not notice one another.

It got a little later, since I had lunch at Nhung's sisters house. But Minh had to pick up a better helmet at her sisters house, so we would meet there. Planned departure time: about 3:00 om. The journey continues: [[Ha Giang loop a second time in 2025]]
