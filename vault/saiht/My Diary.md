One of the building blocks of modern society is certainly the invention of the written word. In my [[Timeline]] project I tried to trace back human history as much as possible, and for every culture this became significantly easier once they started to document their words in some written form.

But this does not only apply for entire civilisations, but individuals as well. Correspondences on old papyri, for example found in [Oxyrhynchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus_Papyri) or letters on clay ostraca like the [Lachish letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachish_letters) give an insight on life of the people there, and helped them document their businesses. The four largest moons of Jupiter are called Galileans, not because he was the first to observe them (Simon Marius observed in November 1609, written record on 29 December 1609 - in Julian calendar, equals 8 January 1610 in the Gregorian calendar) but because we have Galileo's notes from 13 January about the Jupiter moons. The project **Jupyter** took inspiration in this history for their name, in combination with the digital notebook being interactive and also supporting **Python**.
