Minh had organized this trip and invided 5 friends:

We started early, 6:00 at the ferry. So I had to be in district 1 at 5:30. But the day before I had left my bike at the parking and returned 11:00 pm and realized the first time: They close at 10:00 pm. I was there early the next moring at 5:00 only to find out that they open at 7:00 am. So we took Huy's bike, and it did the job for us.

## Challenge
Not everyone is as fit as Minh, so we started with a slow pace. We did not finish the red route as planned, but were devastated on the last stretch. Several pictures are proof. One stop offered fresh nuoc mia, and we rested in a hammock.

About 1.5 years later I will rest there again, but only because of some light rain. And finally finish the loop: [[Núi Đinh II]] on 2025-07-07
