Just a few words and links about the thinks I like to do in my leisure time.
## Hiking
It's a rather common leisure time activity in Germany, or Europe in general, to go on a hike on weekends or on vacations. We found old pictures of my parents taking me and my siblings on a hike during summer vacations in the southern mountains of East Germany in the early 80s.
### Chechia
The neighbouring country Chechia offers great hiking trails in the so called "Sächsische Schweiz". In the 90s you could take a "Schönes Wochenende Ticket" (beautiful weekend ticket) of the Deutsche Bahn (Germain railroad) for just 7.50 Euro to travel all trains inside the country with 5 friends for 2 days. And the last train just stops at a station on the Elbe river on the other side of Chechia, it's just a ferry ride away and you're in a different country! We used this opportunity many times to enjoy nature and upbuilding company with friends on weekend trips there.
### Vietnam
The hiking nature is not yet as developed as in Europe or America, but constantly improving. A few hikes I took:

- [Núi Dinh](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xQxzyHcRg4F7oM7d8) near Vũng Tàu, some 450 meters high and 2h25 away from Hoof Chis Minh City.
