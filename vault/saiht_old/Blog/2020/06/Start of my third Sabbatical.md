This Monday, June 8th, is not yet a day to rest. My solar project at the AISVN is not done yet, there are many things to connect. So I drive to the school in the morning and start soldering ESP32 controller boards to self-designed mainboards, and upload some test software.

## Documentation
We have a website from the school that is still active, and has a history part:
- https://sites.google.com/ais.edu.vn/solar
- https://sites.google.com/ais.edu.vn/solar/history

And of course it is documented on GitHub:
- https://kreier.github.io/solarmeter/

There is a dedicated site about this here in this vault:
