I finally installed the "[Novel Word Count](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/novel-word-count)" plugin to see the size of my vault in a quick overview. The current state: 11,107 words for 38 pages. It reminds me of "**editoritis**" in Wikipedia.
## Update Quartz
I have `npm` locally installed. Sometimes there are some updates in Quartz. To include them in my Quartz repository or obsidian vault there are 3 steps from the command line: 
- `npx quartz update`
- `npx quartz sync`
- `npx quartz build --serve`
The key in GitHub allows the automatic update.
