In the last 50 years I lived at more than 10 different places. Each has its own little history.
## 1975-1980 Nauen
In the "Karl-Thon-Straße 10" in Nauen is the place my parents moved in. Living space was scarce in the 80s in East Germany. My parents had to live with my dad's parents in a tiny apartment, shared with his sister and my little nephew Jörg. Living so close together is not without is problems.

To address this situation the government promised to newlywed parents an apartment if they have a child in the first year of marriage. And a year after their wedding I was born - with some additional motivation from this government incentive.
