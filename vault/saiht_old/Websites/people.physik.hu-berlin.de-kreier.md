Actually, the correct address is [people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier](https://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier) but as title for a markdown file no slash can be included.

We got this webspace provided by our university when we started to study there. And the faculty of physics keeps providing this page even after we left the university. Many continue to study there, get their PhD. So the user name does not include any hint of "student" (as does my current student account 51.01.615.002 at the Su Pham university). Now 26 years after starting to study there I still have both the email and my personal website there.

## Speed
Since this is hosted at the server centre of the university, and used for academic research, there are only a few limitations that apply. If we would start to excessively use our account, an administrator would certainly contact us. 

In 2008 I worked with [Wiki2Touch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Technik/Text/Reader/Wiki2Touch) and compiled some images of updated German and English versions. To store these files I uploaded them temporarily to the webspace of the university, but it easily exceeded my balance. Then I tried to host it on Source Forge in America and was surprised, that the ftp speed was exceeding 1.5 GBit/s. The project did not continue much longer (see more at [www.infodisiac.com/Wikipedia/](https://www.infodisiac.com/Wikipedia/)), each update was time consuming and far too often one looks for a more recent article.

Yet it was fun in 2009 to use my iPod touch with an offline copy of the German Wikipedia and listen to my students quoting an article almost word-for-word during their presentation.
