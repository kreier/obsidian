Over the last decades I traveled to many places and met great people. To assist my memory and reflect on lessons learned I started documenting my journeys on https://saiht.de in 1999. Since 2025 I try to have an updated list here in Obsidian, too.

## 2025
- Roadtrip to BMT, Pleiku, Mang Den, Hue, Danang, Hoi An, Quy Nhon and Phan Thiet
- [[Three day journey to Hanoi 2025]]
- [[One week in Hanoi and Sapa 2025]]
- [[Ha Giang loop a second time in 2025]]
## 2024
- Shanghai twice
- 6 weeks Germany for the 50th anniversary of my parents
## 2023
- Dallas for VEX World
- South America the whole January
## 2022
- December in Taipei, Taiwan for the VEX signature event at TAS
- July in Baltimore for AP CSP workshop, then Washington DC, New York and New Orleans, Louisiana
## 2000
- Eight weeks in Africa, from Nairobi, Kenya to Johannesburg, South Africa. In total 10 countries, and a great memory.

The website fla-shop.com has a tool to click on countries you traveled to and create a graph. Here [is the link](https://www.fla-shop.com/visited-countries/?st=AD%2CAM%2CAR%2CAT%2CBA%2CBE%2CBG%2CBO%2CBR%2CBW%2CBY%2CBZ%2CCA%2CCH%2CCL%2CCN%2CCR%2CCZ%2CDE%2CDK%2CEE%2CES%2CFI%2CFR%2CGB%2CGE%2CGR%2CGT%2CHN%2CHR%2CHU%2CID%2CIL%2CIN%2CIS%2CIT%2CJO%2CJP%2CKE%2CKH%2CKR%2CLA%2CLI%2CLS%2CLT%2CLU%2CLV%2CMC%2CMD%2CME%2CMK%2CMM%2CMO%2CMW%2CMX%2CMY%2CMZ%2CNA%2CNI%2CNL%2CNO%2CPA%2CPE%2CPH%2CPL%2CPS%2CPT%2CPY%2CQA%2CRO%2CRS%2CRU%2CSE%2CSG%2CSI%2CSK%2CSY%2CTH%2CTR%2CTW%2CTZ%2CUA%2CUS%2CUY%2CVA%2CVN%2CXK%2CZA%2CZM%2CZW&vc=1ca032&uc=b3c3ca&hc=40bfa6&bc=ffffff&ss=on). The embedded does not work. When rendered, it looks like this:

The middle east, most of Africa, Australia and the northern part of South America are missing.
