# Data for my obsidian vault and diary

I scattered my notes on so many places, and in different languages too, it will be an interesting project to consolidate all of this one day.

Since December 2025 my old WordPress blog is working again at saiht.de/blog and has currently 91 entries. It can be exported as `.csv` with simple data and name of the post, or even incluce the content.

At the same time, the obsidian vault at [quartz](https://kreier.github.io/quartz/) has 36 markdown files.

This repository should one day create statistics and visualize it like its done on [https://kreier.github.io/statistics-diary/](https://kreier.github.io/statistics-diary/)
