This vault should help me to organize several of my projects and [[My Websites]], ideas and questions. Here is an attempt to an organized overview:
## [[My Websites]] 1999-2025
Over 26 years I have several websites. By the end of 2025, only 3 of these are still active:
- [saiht.de](https://saiht.de) since 1999, my personal page, see [[saiht.de]]
- [kreier.org](https://kreier.org) since 2018, my page for professional things, see
- [people.physik.hu-beriln.de/~kreier/](https://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/) since 2000, my page related to my study of physics at the **Humboldt Universität von Berlin**, see 

More details are listed and linked in the [[My Websites]] page. And for each site I made a separate history page: [[saiht.de]] 1999-2025, kreier.org, people.physik.hu/berlin.de/~kreier/, saiht.org, hofkoh.de, stemfair.org, mypdesign.org, lacy.de, saiht.net (2002-2004).
## [[Projects overview]]
While learning about LLMs I tried to run a local cluster with [[GPGPU]]s from [[Nvidia]], using their [[CUDA]] cores with ollama.
## [[My Blog]]
Not everything is a project, or belongs to the Travel category. But it's worth remembering, to reflect on one's course in life. So I write down some notes about it.
## History
On November 21st, 2024, I started to use Obsidian to organize and collect my thoughts, while in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It took until one other visit in October 2025 to get it synced to Github and [published on GitHub](https://kreier.github.io/quartz) with Quartz 4.5.2 and on [saiht.de/obsidian](https://saiht.de/obsidian).
## Footnotes
This is a blank Quartz installation. See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started. And one thing I like is the support for LaTeX, like this [Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether) current.

$$
j^\mu = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\delta\mathcal{L}}{\delta(\partial_\mu\phi_i)}\varphi_i \quad,\quad \varphi_i := \left.\frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial\alpha}\right|_{\alpha=0}
$$
Of course it fulfils the [Continuity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation) :-)
