This vault is another attempt to document and structure some of [[My Projects|my projects]], [[My Websites|websites]], smaller events and ideas from [[About the blog|blog]] and a general overview of events in my life from [[My Diary|my diary]] plus some experiences in my [[Leisure|leisure time]] into **one** cohesive place. And of course include some [[Travel history|travel stories]].

Here are a few highlights:
## [[My Projects]]
My life is filled with unfinished projects and new ideas, that I continue to start pursuing. Documenting and organizing these projects, maybe even to finish them, is just another project. On GitHub I started projects in 2018, and by 2020 there were already 35 projects. At the end of 2025 this has grown to more than 170 repositories, with some (like [timeline](https://github.com/kreier/timeline)) having hundreds of commits.

As of December 22nd, 2025, only 3 projects are documented in this vault.
## [[My Websites]] 1999-2026
Technically this is another project. Or rather, projects. Over the last 27 years I had several websites. Then finally in 2025 I simplified these projects and combined them into one contract. Since 2026 I have only 3 websites left:
- [saiht.de](https://saiht.de) since 1999, my personal page, some details in this vault at [[saiht.de]]
- [kreier.org](https://kreier.org) since 2018, my page for professional things, details in this vault at [[kreier.org]]
- [people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/](https://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/) since 2000, my page related to my study of physics at the **Humboldt Universität von Berlin**, see (to be completed)

More details are listed and linked in the [[My Websites]] page. And for each site I made a separate history page: [[saiht.de]] 1999-2025, kreier.org, people.physik.hu/berlin.de/~kreier/, saiht.org, hofkoh.de, stemfair.org, mypdesign.org, lacy.de, saiht.net (2002-2004).

## [[Travel history]]
It is good from time to time to reflect on the good things one received in life. That is certainly true for journeys to remote places and time with friends. Both the travel itself as time remembering can fill us with gratitude.

Documenting my travels was already a part of my first edition of [[saiht.de]] in 1999. For the trip to Asia in 1998 I bought a book with black pages, since the contrast to the images let them appear more vibrant. A lot has happened since then.
## [[About the blog]]
Not everything is a **project**, or belongs to the **travel** category. But it's worth remembering, to reflect on one's course in life. So I write down some notes about it.

In 2008 I started a blog on [saiht.de/blog](https://saiht.de/blog/) and had 97 entries until the end of 2025. With Obsidian I copied some stories over, translated them, expanded them and continued to document pieces of my life.
## [[My Diary]]

<img src="/Diary/files/oxyrynchus.jpg" align="right" width="25%"> I started a diary several times both physical on paper and digital in many different software solutions and platforms (OneNote, Google Docs, Apple Notes and Journal, Markdown, GitHub, Website) that is scattered around. Here I try to consolidate these all into my Obsidian vault and store it in the Markdown format with GitHub backup. That's my plan in 2025, at least. In a few years I will look back. In November 2025 I have some notes for [[2025]], [[2024]] and [[2023]].

A part of my diary is also the story of [[Leisure]] activities and places I have been [[Working]] and [[Living]].

## Statistics
With several digital places for information, and countless paper documents and other artifacts one might wonder: "How extensive is this project?" Well, I have some answers.
## History
On November 21st, 2024, I started to use Obsidian to organize and collect my thoughts, while in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It took until one other visit in October 2025 to get it synced to GitHub and [published on GitHub](https://kreier.github.io/quartz) with Quartz 4.5.2 and on [saiht.de/obsidian](https://saiht.de/obsidian).
## Footnotes
This is a blank Quartz installation. See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started. And one thing I like is the support for LaTeX, like this [Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether) current.

$$
j^\mu = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\delta\mathcal{L}}{\delta(\partial_\mu\phi_i)}\varphi_i \quad,\quad \varphi_i := \left.\frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial\alpha}\right|_{\alpha=0}
$$
Of course it fulfils the [Continuity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation) :-)
