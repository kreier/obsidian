This vault is another attempt to document and structure some of [[My Projects|my projects]], [[My Websites|websites]], short ideas in a [[About the blog|blog]] and a general overview of events in my life in a central place. 

Here are a few highlights:
## [[My Projects]]
While learning about LL

Which is should help me to organize several of my or [[My Projects]] [[My Projects]] and [[My Websites]], ideas and questions. Below is an attempt to a structured and organized short overview:
## [[My Websites]] 1999-2025
Over the last 26 years I had several websites. By the end of 2025, only 3 of these are still active:
- [saiht.de](https://saiht.de) since 1999, my personal page, see [[saiht.de]]
- [kreier.org](https://kreier.org) since 2018, my page for professional things, see [[kreier.org]]
- [people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/](https://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~kreier/) since 2000, my page related to my study of physics at the **Humboldt Universität von Berlin**, see (to be completed)

More details are listed and linked in the [[My Websites]] page. And for each site I made a separate history page: [[saiht.de]] 1999-2025, kreier.org, people.physik.hu/berlin.de/~kreier/, saiht.org, hofkoh.de, stemfair.org, mypdesign.org, lacy.de, saiht.net (2002-2004).
## [[My Projects]]
While learning about LLMs I tried to run a local cluster with [[GPGPU]]s from [[Nvidia]], using their [[CUDA]] cores with ollama.
## [[About the blog]]
Not everything is a project, or belongs to the Travel category. But it's worth remembering, to reflect on one's course in life. So I write down some notes about it.
## Diary
I started a diary several times both physical on paper and digital in many different software solutions and platforms (OneNote, Google Docs, Apple Notes and Journal, Markdown, GitHub, Website) that is scattered around. Here I try to consolidate these all into my Obsidian vault and store it in the Markdown format with GitHub backup. That's my plan in 2025, at least. In a few years I will look back. In November 2025 I have some notes for [[2025]], [[2024]] and [[2023]].

A part of my diary is also the story of [[Leisure]] activities and places I have been [[Working]] and [[Living]].
## History
On November 21st, 2024, I started to use Obsidian to organize and collect my thoughts, while in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It took until one other visit in October 2025 to get it synced to GitHub and [published on GitHub](https://kreier.github.io/quartz) with Quartz 4.5.2 and on [saiht.de/obsidian](https://saiht.de/obsidian).
## Footnotes
This is a blank Quartz installation. See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started. And one thing I like is the support for LaTeX, like this [Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether) current.

$$
j^\mu = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\delta\mathcal{L}}{\delta(\partial_\mu\phi_i)}\varphi_i \quad,\quad \varphi_i := \left.\frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial\alpha}\right|_{\alpha=0}
$$
Of course it fulfils the [Continuity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation) :-)
