# Projects
While learning about LLMs I tried to run a local cluster with [[GPGPU]]s from [[Nvidia]], using their [[CUDA]] cores with ollama.
## History

Starting November 21st, 2024 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, I use Obsidian to organize and collect my thoughts.

## Footnotes

This is a blank Quartz installation. See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started. And one thing I like is the support for LaTeX, like this [Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether) current.

$$
j^\mu = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\delta\mathcal{L}}{\delta(\partial_\mu\phi_i)}\varphi_i \quad,\quad \varphi_i := \left.\frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial\alpha}\right|_{\alpha=0}
$$
Of course it fulfils the [Continuity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation) :-)
